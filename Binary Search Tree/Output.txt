Construct an empty BST


BST is empty!

The height is = -1

Number of nodes is = 0

Number of leaves is = 0


Now insert a bunch of integers into the BST

Try items not in the BST and some that are in it:

Items to insert (-999 to stop): 60

The height is = 0

Number of nodes is = 1

Number of leaves is = 1

Items to insert (-999 to stop): 20

The height is = 0

Number of nodes is = 1

Number of leaves is = 1

Items to insert (-999 to stop): 70

The height is = 1

Number of nodes is = 2

Number of leaves is = 1

Items to insert (-999 to stop): 10

The height is = 1

Number of nodes is = 3

Number of leaves is = 2

Items to insert (-999 to stop): 40

The height is = 2

Number of nodes is = 4

Number of leaves is = 2

Items to insert (-999 to stop): 50

The height is = 2

Number of nodes is = 5

Number of leaves is = 3

Items to insert (-999 to stop): 30

The height is = 3

Number of nodes is = 6

Number of leaves is = 3

Items to insert (-999 to stop): 30

The number has existed!

Items to insert (-999 to stop): -999

The height is = 3

Number of nodes is = 7

Number of leaves is = 4


     70

60

               50

          40

               30

Postorder Traversal of BST:

Now testing the contains() operation.

Try both items in the BST and some not in it:

Item to Find (-999 to stop): 30

Found

Item to Find (-999 to stop): 45

NOT Found

Item to Find (-999 to stop): -999

NOT Found


Now testing the remove() operation

Try both items in the BST and some not in it:

     70

60

               50

          40
